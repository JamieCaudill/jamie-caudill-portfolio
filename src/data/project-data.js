    "summary": "At myBalto Foundation, we offer SaaS solutions to create, manage, and track angel funds for veterinary hospitals, while also providing fundraising services. Our goal is to prevent economic euthanasia, increase the number of pets receiving life-saving care, and reduce the compassion fatigue experienced by veterinarians. As the sole Full Stack Software Developer for both the for-profit and non-profit branches, I am responsible for reading, writing, testing, and deploying the majority of features and updates across several web-based applications. My role requires the ability to multi-task and adapt quickly to the dynamic demands of a small-team startup, navigating a wide array of technologies. Within my first month, I successfully reduced costs by over $2,000 annually by utilizing SDKs and APIs to eliminate the need for external SaaS providers for the charity platform. Currently, I manage four different web-based applications: two in production and two in development.",

We aim to enhance the company's exposure and functionality by providing them with a full-stack web application. In order to meet the business needs of this small company, we created a front end application focused on streamlining the user experience by beautifully displaying products and allowing buyers to easily place orders. After an order is submitted, the customer receives a detailed confirmation email, and the sellers receive an emailed order form containing the customer's contact information and requested items. Payment is handled externally, in line with the businesses current practices. This application was built with scalability and longevity in mind, and we are proud to have created a website tailored to the company's specific needs.",
