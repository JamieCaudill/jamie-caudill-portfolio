The user may choose to add their favorite quote posters to a collection, or create their own. This project was completed during Mod 3 of Turing School of Software and Design. The primary goal was to learn and implement a new technology. We chose to build a backend infrastructure, creating a robust database and server with functional endpoints to provide our quotes and images, as well as save any user favorited posters. We completed this project over the course of 12 days, including planning, research and excecution phases. ",

The search function takes in a date with the option to filter by room type. Once the search results are displayed, the user is able to view room details, and book an available room. Once booked, the room is added to their bookings and the total spent is updated. The users bookings will be available even after page refresh.
