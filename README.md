# PORTFOLIO

## by Jamie Caudill

### DESCRIPTION

Built with React, styled with SASS, and animated with GSAP, my portfolio not only displays the projects I have completed in the past, but represents a culmination of the skills I have developed throughout my time at Turing School of Software and Design. Starting with a blank canvas, I used excalidraw to lay the blueprint for the UI/UX, and then used Github Projects to lay out the Issues that I would tackle to implement the design I had created. I then chose the technologies that would allow me to efficiently and effectively build the website. The result is a web-application that represents my skills and capabilities as a developer while also reflecting my personality.
